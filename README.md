# Tschichold
Theoretical page layout brought to the digital age.

Tschichold is a page layout tool that is based on the [classic canons of page construction][canons].

## The canons of page construction
The *canons of page construction* are a set of principles in the field of book design used to describe the ways that page proportions, margins and type areas (print spaces) of books are constructed.

The notion of canons, or laws of form, of book page construction was popularized by Jan Tschichold in the mid to late twentieth century, based on the work of J. A. van de Graaf, Ra&uacute;l M. Rosarivo, Hans Kayser, and others. 

Tschichold wrote &ldquo;Though largely forgotten today, methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed for centuries. To produce perfect books these rules have to be brought to life and applied.&rdquo;.

## Golden ratio and Construction by division
Tschichold's "golden canon of page construction"[1] is based on simple integer ratios, equivalent to Rosarivo's "typographical divine proportion."

Tschichold's "golden canon of page construction" here illustrated by a synthesis of Tschichold's figure thereof, with the diagonals and circle, combined with Rosarivo's construction by division of the page into ninths. These two constructions rely on the 2:3 page ratio to give a type area height equal to page width as demonstrated by the circle, and result in margin proportions 2:3:4:6. For other page ratios, Rosarivo's method of ninths is equivalent to van de Graaf's canon, as Tschichold observed.
